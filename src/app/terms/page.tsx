      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Welcome to StudyBuddy! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the StudyBuddy platform,
        including all related services and applications (collectively, the "Service"). By registering for or using StudyBuddy,

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        You must provide accurate and complete information when creating your account. You are solely responsible for maintaining

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-blue-700">3. Role-Based Access</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        There are two types of users on StudyBuddy:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Students</strong>, who can browse and enroll in courses.</li>
        <li><strong>Tutors</strong>, who can create and offer educational content, manage sessions, and interact with students.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-blue-700">4. Tutor Compensation & Platform Fee</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Tutors set their own prices for the courses they offer. However, by using StudyBuddy, you agree that the platform will
        retain <strong>15% of the total course fee</strong> as a service fee. The remaining 85% will be made available for
        withdrawal after the course is purchased.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <strong>For example:</strong> If a course is priced at $100, StudyBuddy will retain $15, and the tutor will receive $85.
